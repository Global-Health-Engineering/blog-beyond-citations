abstract: "Current research impact assessments prioritize journal citations, neglecting significant contributions and visibility of non-traditional outputs. This article explores how Global Health Engineering (GHE) measures its research visibility using metadata from diverse digital platforms. Focusing on ETHâ€™s Research Collection and LinkedIn, we show how data on views, downloads, and demographics offers insights into dissemination and engagement. The "ghedata" R package makes this metadata open for analysis, inspiring researchers to adopt comprehensive strategies for showcasing their work's true reach and impact."
